//- Coming from development on the Unix platform, I was used to build systems 
//- using Make. It had already all that I needed; **parallel
//- and sequential target construction, incremental build and portability**. 

//- A plain makefile for a webapp can contain a lot of boilerplate. **Diy** offers 
//- an opinionated API for rapidly building the tree structure of the build, 
//- by allowing the user to directly specify how to invoke tool on the command line.
