Introduction
===============================

Diy is a build language embedded in Javascript. It allows to generate Make files for your web site or web app.

All classic transforms are supported such as reductions (e.g., concatenation), post-processing (e.g., minification) and so on.

Enables Make to exploit available parallelism.

Compile only what has changed.

Specify directly how build tools should be invoked on the command line.

Diy comes with a library of transforms already baked in.
